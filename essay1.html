                                    <h1>Essay #1 Ancients With Tech</h1>22 Oct 2017
                                    <br>
                                    <br> One of my great memories is driving with my grandfather, riding in his truck filled with a lot of timber, nails and other materials.
                                    <br> He took me to various places, like the top of buildings that were under construction, a huge tunnel, and a new house which was about to be finalized; even though the buyer had never entered it.
                                    <br> In those days, everything I saw, touched and heard had a grand scale.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a href="/img/P1150748.png" data-toggle="lightbox">
                                        <img src="/img/P1150748.png" class="img-fluid" width="50%">
                                    </a>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>-----
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Nowadays, as a software engineer, I work in the IT field so that people can get the benefit of the another concept: digital.
                                    <br> Through my work, people are able to experience the grand scale of the digital age; the same kind of experience I had with my grandfather many years ago.
                                    <br> The current tide <span class="spice">"Everything Goes Digital"</span> is one of the great challenges for me (and for mankind).
                                    <br>
                                    <br> While I was doing my job, I sometimes felt discouraged.
                                    <br>As a person who was born in the analog era, then grew up during the digital age, I was unsure how to deal with such dramatic change.
                                    <br> Because of the shift to digital, things were replaced more quickly that I expected, so I didnâ€™t have enough time to prepare for it.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a href="/img/P1150753.png" data-toggle="lightbox">
                                        <img src="/img/P1150753.png" class="img-fluid" width="50%">
                                    </a>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>-----
                                    <br>
                                    <br> That is why I started my own project<span class="spice"> "Ancients With Tech"</span>.
                                    <br> It is a project that observes and identifies how people adapt to such game changers (cutting edge technologies) in their particular situation.
                                    <br>I will observe several fields to understand the effect of the change to digital.
                                    <br> <a href="/img/P1150756.png" data-toggle="lightbox">
                                          <img src="/img/P1150756.png" class="img-fluid" width="50%">
                                    </a>
                                    <br>
                                    <br> The first field I will observe is architecture.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> There are many unique buildings, houses and landmarks throughout the world, and people adjust the style of them depending on the climate, available materials, lifestyle etc.
                                    <br> It means that every specific place has its own way, its own rule.
                                    <br> I am very interested in this, and want to learn more.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Furthermore, one of the things that I am really interested in is the possibility of humans "surviving" in nature, even if there are no useful tools, equipment or preparation; a lifestyle like our ancestors thousands of years ago. I believe that people who are able to create something from scratch are really strong, and our ancestors had many great achievements.
                                    <br> Nowadays, more and more things are produced, and more and more things are abandoned in our mass consumption society. I want to find out how mankind will react to the new waves of technology to come.
